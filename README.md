Significant amounts of work went into collating this dataset. If you utilise this dataset, please cite both the above paper and the original data sources.


The excel spreadsheet "FaFs_EPMAdata_KirbyEtAl2025.xlsx" allows users to input EPMA data for olivine and orthopyroxene compositions of meteorites and receive an output of the Fa and Fs compositions including mean, 1SD, n and Delta MOO. The mean Fa and Fs are then plot over the dataset collated in the manuscript to aid in classification.

The excel spreadsheets "OIsotopes_KirbyEtAl2025.xlsx" and "FaFs_plot_KirbyEtAl2025.xlsx" allows users to input mean results directly which are then plot over the dataset collated in the manuscript.
